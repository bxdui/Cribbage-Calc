As an avid cribbage player but horrible score counter, I strive to create a Python program that will do the work for me and settle disputes in score!

I strive to strengthen my data management and calculation skills in Python through creating this program.

I expect the program to count every point from a user-input cribbage hand, including nibs-nobs and flip-card-dependant flushes. In the future, I hope to add other functions that
will optimize counting dependent on the deck's remaining cards, factor in the crib, and maybe even develop a functioning cribbage app.
